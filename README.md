# ValidatingCPF

This Chrome Extension was developed to help my work team to do the register on our main system easearly. In our routine, we receive the datas by email (sometimes the CPF number with special characters). In our system, only after register a person (inserting the CPF number without special characters and another datas) and register anothers datas on aggregated system we know if the CPF number is invalid, having then, in this case, to delete the all the register. In it, it's possible insert a CPF (brazilian individual registration) with special characters and then, receive only the numbers and if it is a valid CPF number.

# How to set up to use it
After download, open the Google Chrome browser, and click on three point button, then more tools and Extensions. Click on Developer Mode button and load unpacked and select the folder where the download was saved.

# How to use it
Just insert the CPF number and click on "Enviar" button. The system will return a message in red letters wit a message if it's a invalid number or a green one if it's valid. If inserted a new number the app will show a new message for that number. The "Limpar" button may be used to stop showing the result of the research.
